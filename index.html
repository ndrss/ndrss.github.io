			^ That line is also very helpful. It doesn't really have any effect on desktop web browsers, but on smartphones and tablets, if we didn't include that line, they would default to just shrinking down the desktop-sized website. This tells those browsers (that are really just trying to be helpful), "It's cool, I got this, just own your smaller screen size. Don't pretend to be something you're not." Without this we'd all still be using websites on our phones by zooming in and out all the time just to figure out what we're looking for in the first place.

			Briefly: that tag enables us to make a responsive web page. More in "main.css".

			You probably noticed that nothing in the "head" had to do with the actual contents of the page. That's what the "body" is for. An HTML document has one "html" element that contains everything. Inside it goes one "head" for meta information and one "body" for content. That's it.

			You may find it useful to think of it all as a tree. Here's an incomplete picture of this document's tree:

			          html              
			           +                
			           |                
			  +--------+--------+       
			head               body     
			 +                  +       
			 |                  |       
			 +             +----+---+   
			title        header  article
			               +            
			               |            
			             +-+-+          
			             h1  h2

				^ That's a link, which I've given a class I decided to call button. In the "main.css", I'll be able to refer to any link with this class with ".button". Handy.

				Right now, it doesn't link anywhere. The "#" in the href is a conventional way to do a little placeholder until you know where you're going to link to.

				Try this: put a file in this folder and name it something like "portfolio.pdf". (It's actually important that the file name not include any spaces, and it's generally preferred that it be in all lowercase.) Then change the "#" to read "portfolio.pdf".
